## ThreeJS Audio Visualizer

A virtual spoken word exhibit. Objects animate along to the frequencies of the background music while a hand model distorts to the volume of the spoken word.

## Development

To get started, you simply need to run the following commands:

`npm install && npm run dev`

Then you can access localhost:8000. There's no hot code reloading, so you'll need to refresh after any code changes.

## Deploy

Run `npm run build` then serve index.html, dist, and static.
